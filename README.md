# RAM-and-Buffer-of-FPGA
This project constructs a 4-bit and 8-bit Rom Based Sign Magnitude Adder. This was done by first writing a program 
inconventional programming language like excel to implement a 28-by-4 and 216-by-8-bit truth table. 
 
## Description
For this project I constructed a conventional programming language in excel to implement a 28-by-4 and 216-by-8-bit truth table. From there I implemented the table into my main file and made a testbench where I used a for loop to search through various addresses in the ROM.
